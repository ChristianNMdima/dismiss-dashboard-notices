Adds a "Hide/Show Notices" button to the WordPress dashboard and allows you to remember visibility settings across sessions.

== Description ==

Tired of admin notices cluttering your dashboard? This lightweight plugin adds a toggle button to hide or show **all admin dashboard notices** with a single click.

Features:

* Toggle visibility of all admin notices (core, plugin, and WooCommerce notices)
* Option to **remember visibility** using localStorage
* Simple and clean UI — looks native to the dashboard
* Includes a settings page under **Settings > Dismiss Notices**

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install via WordPress Plugin Manager.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > Dismiss Notices** to configure the visibility behavior.
4. On the dashboard, use the **Hide Notices / Show Notices** button above the widgets area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin permanently remove notices? =

= Will it affect other admin pages? =

Currently, it only applies to the **WordPress dashboard** (the main admin homepage).

= Does it remember my preference after reload? =

Yes, if the setting is enabled under **Settings > Dismiss Notices**.
